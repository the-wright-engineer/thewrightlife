**Hello, we're the Wright Family!**

We are just an ordinary family who loves to serve an extraordinary God.

We are church planters in the best city, Boston (Go Red Sox!).

We are parents to the funniest one year old-Hudson.

And we are Jesus followers who love a good cup of coffee, many laughs, and delicious food from all over the world (the spicier the better).
