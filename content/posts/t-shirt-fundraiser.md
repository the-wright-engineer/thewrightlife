We are working with Fund the Nations (a company that designs great T-shirts to help people fund raise missions/adoption). We centered the T-shirt design around the verse "His grace is sufficient" (2 Corinth. 12:9) because it represents our prayer as we take this step of faith to adopt. While we do not know what the future holds, we know our God is sufficient to supply in our weakness and we wholly lean on that.

#### **How you can help:**

1. Buy a T-shirt!
2. Share this in your circle of people (church, family, coworkers, friends, etc.)

Our goal is to sell 200 t-shirts to help fund these beginning expenses of our adoption.  We will submit the order in 2 weeks (5/18) and your shirts should land at your front door around 2 weeks after that! We have people in Charlotte, NC & Boston, MA who will hand deliver your t-shirt, but if you are in another location we will ship to you once the shirts come in.

Every shirt we sell is one step closer to bringing our kiddo home. Thank you in advance for helping us make sure there is one less orphan.
