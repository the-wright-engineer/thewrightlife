_God decided in advance to **adopt** us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. - Ephesians 1:5_

**Why are you adopting?:**

As Christians God has commanded us to care for orphans. We don't begrudgingly obey this command but we delight in caring for orphans because we were spiritual orphans! We were lost in our sin and shame and Jesus came after us! He not only washed us and made us clean in Gods sight but He invites us to be in His family. If God has done that for us why would we not do the same for a child in need of a home.

**Why India?:** There are 20 million orphans in India (the country with the most orphans in the world). We want there to be one less. We love India. We love the people, we love the culture, and we REALLY love the food (give us all the samosas and chaat).

**What does a "special needs" adoption mean?:**

We are in a special needs program. This means that any child we bring home will have some kind of medical need. These needs can vary from minor (cleft palate, learning disabilities, missing limbs) to something more severe (such as deafness, blindness, heart conditions, etc). Often times children with these needs are looked over, we want to be a family that _chooses_ the one others look over (isn't that what Jesus did for us? He looked at our sin, shame and weakness and CHOSE us).

**How long will it take?:**

Our agency has guessed around 1.5 years but it could be longer or shorter. We are currently in the homestudy process and once that is complete we will be eligible to be matched with a child waiting for a family!

**How much does it cost?:**

$30,000. Those fees include things such as agency fees, plane tickets, visas, court fees, background checks, gathering documents, etc.

This would be impossible if we didn't have a God who owns all things! We are trusting him to supply (and while we are adjusting our budget to try and squeeze out every penny) this will truly take a village.

Is all this worth it? All the paper work, the waiting, the money... for one child. Yes. 1000x yes.

We're excited to have you join us on this journey. We can't wait for the day we can introduce you to our newest little member of the Wright family.

Love,

Bradley, Haley, and Hudson
