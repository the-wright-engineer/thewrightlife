Yep. You heard that right! Baby Wright (or as we have affectionately named him/her Baby Squishy) is due to arrive in March. For the past 6 months we have been adjusting to life in Boston, figuring out public transportation, learning not to cry in traffic and adjusting our budget to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

A few months ago we were feeling pretty good about life and after prayer and discussion decided to take the first steps to pursue International Adoption. We went through the overwhelming process of picking an agency, sorted through lots of emails, and finally landed on a decision.

There were phone calls, spreadsheets of expenses, and a long checklist of to-dos. However, to our surprise, at the time we were prepared to make our adoption plans public, we found out that God planned to start our family a different way.

You can see my reaction and the text message I sent to Bradley below. (probably not prettiest baby announcement out there...)

So, there ya have it. Now that the shock has worn off and we have had a firm reminder that God controls all of our plans, we are excited for this new season of life as parents!

And for those of you who are wondering, Adoption is still in our heart it's just on pause. We're trying to take the one baby at a time route ;)

Thanks for your encouragement, prayers and excitement with us!
