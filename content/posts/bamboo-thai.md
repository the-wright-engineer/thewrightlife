* Cost: $$ out of 5
* Atmosphere: Very quiet, gorgeous salt water aquarium in the center of the restaurant.
* Food: delicious and mild. May need more spice for those who prefer more heat.

Featured Meal 1: Crispy Pad Thai consisting of crispy egg noodle stir fry with chicken and shrimp, egg, turnip, scallions, bean sprouts and peanuts.

Featured Meal 2: Curry Chicken Noodle Soup w/ Tofu, Chinese Broccoli, Bean Sprouts, Cilantro Turnip in Mild Curry Broth w/ Fried Onions...add A TRUCKLOAD of red pepper and you have a DELICIOUS MEAL *obviously Haley ordered this dish*![Haley's Dish](/images/blog/2018-03/haley-thai-dish.jpg)
