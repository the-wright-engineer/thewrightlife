I was **NOT** prepared to find a place in Boston. If you are moving to this lovely city, make sure your wallet is full, and your expectations are low. Here are a few things I wish I would've known:

* Be prepared to lay down a lot of cash. If you find a place for $2000 you should expect to put down first and last month's rent, a brokers fee, and a security deposit making your grand total $8000 minimum (add to that an application fee and key fee). Yup, you may need to sell your plasma to move to Boston...and maybe some other non-essential organs on the black market.
* Don't expect many suburban conveniences to be included (a parking spot, laundry in your unit, a dishwasher, and closets could likely not be a part of your new living situation)
* If it's cheap, it's cheap for a reason. Enough said.

**So why move to Boston?**

Well, the beautiful city, rich history and amazing restaurants certainly don't hurt. For myself and Bradley, we keep re-arranging our lives to move to this city because God is moving in Boston and we want to be apart of it. We want to see His grace change lives like He has changed ours.

*PS- if you're wondering, we did find a place and we cannot wait to make it our home (more on that soon!)*
