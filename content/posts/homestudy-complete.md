We're announcing this months later than expected but we are **FINALLY** home study approved! We ran into to SEVERAL unexpected hurdles during this first phase (Covid slowing down processes, India changing their age requirements, and an important government document getting lost and requiring us to resubmit it). However, after all those challenges we made it! 

**So, What's next?**

We have been registered as an adoptive family on CARINGS (this is India's adoption database). We will now be waiting on India to officially approve us. We are praying God would bring this approval not one day early but not a second too late and that he would give us favor in the eyes of those who are reading our file. Once we get this approval we will be able to be matched with our kiddo. 

This approval can take several months so we are preparing ourselves to hunker down and wait for a while, but its always exciting to wait for something new because every step is one step closer to our kiddo! 

**Where are you with fundraising?**

We have a little over $12,000 raised/saved to cover our upcoming expenses. It has been amazing to see how God has been quite literally pouring out provision as we continue on this journey. 

We still have about another $18,000 left:

$6000 for after we have matched with our child (lawyer fees, medical fees, and court fees)

$12,000 for travel and post adoption (attorney fees, citizenship fees, etc)

We'll be announcing our next fundraiser soon!

Thank you for your continual support, encouragement and prayers,

_The Wright Family_
