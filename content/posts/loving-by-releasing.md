That little blue line slowly faded onto the pregnancy test. My plans and ideas came to a crashing halt and I heard that all familiar voice, the voice of God in the stillness..."Release it. Release your plans"

I received this new gift of a promised child and yearned to see your squishy face and tiny fingers. The weeks passed and you grew, slowly but surely, and then came the blood. I trembled and held my stomach where you were supposed to safely grow. I cried into your Daddy's arms and said "this isn't supposed to happen" and that tender voice came yet again, "Release it. Release your anxieties."

After a long night in the ER and an assumed miscarriage the ultrasound tech somberly gave us the news "Sorry, but there's no baby in there". Your Daddy held my hand with just the right amount of tenderness and strength. We breathed in accepting this new reality and then just as quick as we thought it was over, she piped up quickly "Wait! Wait a minute...there it is. There's the heartbeat. Nice and strong" she said. 

Hope restored. 

**But**. The doctor said "the baby is alive now, but there is still bleeding, the baby may not make it. You have a 50% chance." 

50%. That sounded like a decent chance until it was the probability of your life. I could feel the wave of fear rising and there it was again, ever faithful: "release it, release your fear." 

He sustained your life, the Creator did, by the very Word of His power. 

The day finally came. What I thought was a tummy ache turned out to be contractions. 36 hours my body fought. 36 agonizing hours. Many times it felt my body and you were working against me. I cried with what energy I had left "I cant, I can't do it." The disappointment and shame hovered over me. Your Daddy knelt down near me and began to pray "Oh Father, would you strengthen Haley. Would you orchestrate her body to do what it needs to do. Would you guard Hudson's life and bring him safely to us. Would you comfort her in her pain" And there he was. Drawing near to me yet again. "Release it. Release your Abilities. My power is made perfect in your weakness."

1:48 AM on March 22 the room filled with relief and joy "He's here, he's here!" your Daddy proclaimed. And there you were, on my chest, peering into my eyes and it felt as if I'd never known a day without you. 

They let us take you home (I'm still convinced they should've made us pass a test before they entrusted us with your life) and we entered into our new life as a family of three. 

You and I were inseparable. Just when I thought we were getting the hang of this keeping you alive thing you weren't gaining weight. I would try to feed you you and you would cry and cry. You didn't sleep. ever. But we weren't mad because you would scrunch up your face and we knew you were hurting. One doctor turned into 5 and 1 appointment turned into too many to count. There were tests and medicines and a lot of praying that God would grow your body and heal what was broken. We were weary and He met us yet again "Release it. Release your expectations."

We sat together on the couch and you were crying again, telling me you were hungry, and I was crying too, trying to get you to eat. I felt despair and failure and tense. so tense. And His presence swept over me. "Release it. Release your pride." and I did. Over and over and over again. 

God settled your stomach and helped you eat and you grew. You got a small little roll on your wrist and we celebrated like we won the lottery. Your crying lessened and your sleep...well that still didn't change but we had come to terms with that. 

And then, somehow, seemingly overnight you began crawling and walking, laughing and kissing. You play and giggle and give out the best smiles free of charge. 

It's been a year. A hard, beautiful, fun, sleepless, amazing year. And in 6 days you, my baby, transition to being a toddler. I feel that instinct to hold tightly. To keep you my baby. To withhold freedom and to try with all my might to freeze time. But, I hear that sweet, faithful voice yet again, **"Release Him."**

If we have learned anything this year its that to love you well we must release you to the one who loves you best. And as you grow and we watch you stumble and fall, make mistakes and have big victories, we pray you learn to release it all to him as well. For he is faithful. He is near. He is trustworthy. 

Happy birthday Baby boy, 

Love your Mama.
