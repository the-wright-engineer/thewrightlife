That little blue line slowly faded onto the pregnancy test. My plans and ideas came to a crashing halt and I heard that all familiar voice, the voice of God in the stillness..."release it. release your plans"

I received this new gift of a promised child and yearned to see your squishy face and tiny fingers. The weeks passed and you grew, slowly but surely, and then came the blood. I trembled and held my stomach where you were supposed to safely grow. I cried into your Daddies arms and said "this isn't supposed to happen" and that tender voice came yet again, "release it. release your anxieties."

After a long night in the ER and an assumed miscarriage the ultrasound tech somberly gave us the news "sorry, but there's no baby in there". Your Daddy held my hand with just the right amount of tenderness and strength. We breathed in accepting this new reality we wouldn't get to meet you in this life and then just as quick as we thought it was over, she piped up quickly "Wait! Wait a minute...there it is. There's the heartbeat. Nice and strong" she said. 

Hope restored. 

**But**. The doctor said "the baby is alive now, but there is still bleeding, the baby may not make it. You have a 50% chance." 

50%. That sounds like a decent chance until it was my the probability of your life. I could feel the wave of fear rising and there it was again, ever faithful: "release it, release your fear." 

He sustained your life, the Creator did by the very Word of His power. 

The day finally came. What I thought was a tummy ache turned out to be contractions. 36 hours my body fought. 36 agonizing hours. Many times it felt my body and you were working against me. I cried with what energy I had left "I cant, I can't do it." The disappointment and shame hovered over me. Your Daddy knelt down near me and began to pray "Oh Father, would you strengthen Haley. Would you orchestrate her body to do what it needs to do. Would you guard Hudson's life and bring him safely to us. Would you comfort her in her pain" And there he was. Drawing near to me yet again. "Release it. Release your Abilities. My power is made perfect in your weakness."

1:48 AM on March 22 the room filled with relief and joy "He's here, he's here!" your Daddy proclaimed. And there you were, on my chest, peering into my eyes like I'd never known a day without you. 

They let us take you home (I'm still convinced they didn't make us pass a test before they entrusted us with your life) and we entered into our new life as a family of three.
