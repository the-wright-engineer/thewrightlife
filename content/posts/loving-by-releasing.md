That little blue line slowly faded onto the pregnancy test. My plans and ideas came to crashing halt and I heard that all familiar voice, the voice of God in the stillness..."release it. release your plans"

I received this new gift of a promised child and yearned to see your squishy face and tiny fingers. The weeks passed and you grew, slowly but surely, and then came the blood.
