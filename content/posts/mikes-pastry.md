Best pastries in Boston. Period.

> Founded in 1946, Mike’s Pastry is located in Boston’s historic North End on Hanover Street. Michael Mercogliano (the “Mike” behind the famed Mike’s Pastry) created the one-of-a-kind cannoli that keeps loyal Bostonians and tourists coming from around the world to enjoy.

This place is usually super busy with a line that extends outside, down the street, and around the block! Because it is totally worth it.
