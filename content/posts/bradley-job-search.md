The job search. A daunting first step.

After Haley and I decided Boston was where we were headed to next, the job hunting process began. It did not begin right away for me as my immediate goal was to complete my Master degree at UNC Charlotte. I was about half-way through my degree when Boston popped up on our radar. When Boston came into the picture, Haley and I knew that we had to make completing my degree the top priority in 2017. With much difficulty, many late nights, a lot of frustration, a lot of worry/stress, we eventually made it through 2017 together. I completed my degree and graduated December 2017 with a MS in Information Technology.

That was the beginning, now the pressure was on to find a job in Boston. I probably could have started applying for positions prior to my graduation, however, I felt like I needed to have my degree before I would feel comfortable submitting my resume. So I went through the usual steps of updating the resume, filling in details on LinkedIn, and signing up for various job posting apps/websites. I was nervous because I wasn't sure what I would be qualified for. The reason being that I never had to look for a job after college as I was in my current position through an internship I had the summer before my senior year.

Initially things progressed slowly. Granted, I wasn't making a strong push applying to jobs as I was being a tad picky with what I applied for. However, I began getting calls from recruiters looking to help match me up with positions they were trying to fill for other companies. From this, I lined up a few phone screenings. During this period, I came across CABEM Technologies seeking an individual with development, operations, and security skills in technology. This position wasn't something a typically applied to, but I decided to apply anyway. Immediately, my application was viewed and a couple days later, I got a phone call from the hiring manager. This lead to three Skype interviews, one with the hiring manager, one with the CTO and one with the CEO. Long story short, this would be the company that I would decide to work for up in Boston. My first day with them was March 2, 2018.
