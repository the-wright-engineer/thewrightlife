"How's Boston" I'm asked often...***Different***

The weather

The houses

The prices (ouch)

The traffic

The people

Our walls are wonky, our cars alignment will be forever shot because of potholes, our budget is tight, and our train rides are long but there's a great rest in these things that are different.

The different exposes our prideful expectations and the idols of comfort we hold so dear. With every difference we encounter that we demand must suit our preferences, we are reminded of our Savior that left all comfort, preferences, and the perfect glories of heaven to bring about in us a soul-sustaining peace.

**Through the different, the contentment of an all-satisfying God tastes that much sweeter.**

After 2 months of being Bostonians we are grateful for the differences and we are coming to adore ~~the~~ *OUR* city of Boston
