We have been blown away by the generosity of our family, friends, and complete strangers!

Our goal for this first fundraiser was $2000 and we raised **$4000!** 

To update you on our progress we are making our way through a mountain of paper work, interviews, appointments, etc  (AKA the home study).  Our goal is to be done with our home study by the end of July. 

We'll report back once we have some thing more exciting to share but for now we will keep working through this mountain of paperwork and reminding our selves at the end of all this is our kiddo waiting to come home.
